# Ship Slice

Implement exactly one vertical slice from its GitHub ticket to a production-ready PR.

One slice = one child issue = one worktree = one branch = one PR.

Run each step in order; do not proceed until the current step's `Done when` holds.

## Execution modes

### Orchestrated mode

```text
/ship-slice <issue> orchestrated
```

The orchestrator already selected this slice, created and bootstrapped its Herdr worktree and dedicated branch, and launched this worker inside it.

This worker owns only this slice: no new worktree, no new branch, no sibling slices, no `/slice-relay`, no launching agents, no touching the parent tracker, no merging the PR.

The orchestrator owns scheduling, parallelism, worktree lifecycle, parent state, merge serialization and authorization, and cleanup.

### Standalone mode

```text
/ship-slice <issue>
```

May create its own branch and merge its own PR. Still owns only one slice and must not orchestrate siblings.

## Synchronization recipe

Use whenever this branch must absorb an advanced `origin/$BASE`: before the first push, before declaring readiness, or when the orchestrator revokes readiness.

```bash
git fetch origin "$BASE"
```

Staleness check before first push — count commits missing from this branch:

```bash
git rev-list --count HEAD.."origin/$BASE"
```

Readiness check — require the current base to be contained in this branch:

```bash
git merge-base --is-ancestor "origin/$BASE" HEAD
```

If stale:

```bash
git rebase "origin/$BASE"
```

Resolve conflicts by, in order: current OpenSpec artifacts, current integration-branch behavior, this slice's acceptance criteria, repository domain and architecture conventions. Never blindly take `ours` or `theirs`.

After any meaningful rebase or conflict resolution, rerun `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, and rerun `/code-review` when implementation materially changed.

Push rewritten history with `git push --force-with-lease`; never bare `--force`. Then wait for fresh CI and required reviews, and re-run the readiness check.

## 1. Orient the slice

```bash
gh issue view <N>
```

Resolve the parent tracker, acceptance criteria, declared blockers, referenced OpenSpec change, required skills, and any deliberately deferred behavior.

If this issue itself has implementation sub-issues, it is a tracker, not a slice — stop and direct the caller to `/orchestrate-slices`.

Confirm every declared blocker is completed (GitHub-native blocking relationships when available). If a blocker remains open:

```text
BLOCKED: issue #<N> depends on open issue #<blocker>
```

Stop; do not bypass the dependency graph.

Read the OpenSpec change:

```text
openspec/changes/<change>/
├── proposal.md
├── design.md
├── specs/
└── tasks.md
```

`specs/` is the behavioral contract, `design.md` the intended technical direction, `tasks.md` implementation guidance, and the ticket's acceptance criteria this slice's exact delivery boundary.

Map every acceptance criterion to an implementation surface and a verification method. Name anything deliberately deferred and the ticket that owns it; do not absorb another slice merely because touching it would be convenient.

Done when: scope, blockers, and OpenSpec artifacts are understood; every acceptance criterion has an implementation and verification path; deferred work is owned elsewhere.

## 2. Verify the worktree and branch

```bash
BASE="$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q '.defaultBranchRef.name')"
git fetch origin "$BASE"
BASE_SHA="$(git rev-parse "origin/$BASE")"
```

Record `$BASE_SHA`; step 5's Fallow audit uses it. Branch from and compare against the fetched `origin/$BASE`.

### Orchestrated mode

The branch and worktree already exist. Inspect:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git branch --show-current
git status --short --branch
```

Require: the checked-out branch is the assigned slice branch (never `$BASE`), the worktree is dedicated to this slice, and no unexplained pre-existing application-code changes exist.

Verify bootstrap:

```bash
test -f .env.local
test -d node_modules
git check-ignore -q .env.local
```

Treat `.env.local` as secret: keep it out of prompts, logs, and commits.

If bootstrap is incomplete, report:

```text
BLOCKED: slice #<N> worktree bootstrap incomplete: <reason>
```

Never create a replacement worktree or run another bootstrap yourself.

### Standalone mode

Branch name: `<type>/<N>-<slug>`. Default `feat/`; use `fix/` for bug tickets, `docs/` for documentation-only tickets, `chore/` for maintenance, `hotfix/` for urgent fixes.

```bash
git checkout -b "<type>/<N>-<slug>" "origin/$BASE"
```

Ensure a runnable checkout: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` when dependencies are missing.

Done when: exactly one dedicated slice branch is checked out in a runnable worktree, and `$BASE`/`$BASE_SHA` are recorded.

## 3. Read repository guidance

Follow the repo reference chain before editing: `CONTEXT-MAP.md` → feature `CONTEXT.md` → `docs/adr/` → OpenSpec artifacts. Invoke ticket-required skills before work in their domain (e.g. `/supabase`, `/supabase-postgres-best-practices`, `/tdd`, `/next-best-practices`, `/shadcn`). For database work, follow both Supabase skills when the repository requires them.

Reuse the project's existing architecture and vocabulary; a second convention beside an established one needs a specification-level reason.

Done when: applicable conventions, domain rules, and required skills are loaded.

## 4. Implement the slice

Implement this ticket's complete vertical behavior, cutting through every layer it genuinely needs — schema/data, server logic, validation, authorization, API/server actions, UI, tests. Do not force layers the behavior does not need.

Production bar: no temporary bypasses, debug-only production behavior, TODOs for required functionality, knowingly broken error handling, client-only authorization, or unsafe migrations. Preserve validation at trust boundaries, authorization invariants, security/privacy requirements, data integrity, existing domain terminology, and expected failure behavior.

Use the narrowest implementation that satisfies the accepted spec.

Run focused checks while implementing (`pnpm vitest run <relevant-test>`); do not wait until the end to discover basic breakage.

If the slice requires a genuine specification decision, stop and report:

```text
BLOCKED: issue #<N>
Decision required: <specific unresolved decision>
Why it matters: <implementation consequence>
Recommended: <recommended choice>
```

Do not invent product behavior.

Done when: every acceptance criterion is implemented, focused tests pass, and no known slice-owned behavior remains incomplete.

## 5. Verify the implementation

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

When repository CI requires it, reproduce the Fallow gate:

```bash
pnpm exec tsx scripts/run-fallow-audit.ts "$BASE_SHA"
```

Trace findings before changing code; fix only new findings caused by this slice.

### Database slices

Follow `/supabase` and the repository's Prisma/Supabase migration workflow: verify demo-target isolation, run the dry-run push and read-only preflight counts before any destructive migration, then push, regenerate types, and re-seed idempotently. Applied migrations are frozen — corrections ship as new migration files.

If `@prisma/client` types are stale after a model edit, delete the store `.prisma` dir and regenerate before treating type failures as application bugs.

Done when: every required verification command passes, and migration preflight counts are recorded for the PR body.

## 6. Run the code-review loop

Invoke `/code-review` against `origin/$BASE`. The implementation agent must not substitute its own self-review for the required workflow.

Accept or reject every finding. Accepted findings get fixed. Rejections need concise rationale: incorrect, explicitly required, out-of-slice, or owned by another ticket. A finding may be deferred only when another known ticket owns the work — never as a way to ship a known slice defect.

After material fixes, rerun `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, then `/code-review` again. Repeat until a verified round has no accepted unresolved findings.

Done when: the last review round is clean, all accepted findings are resolved, verification passes after the final material change, and every rejection/deferral rationale is recorded.

## 7. Commit the slice

Commit in logical groups with conventional messages; use `/git-commit` when available. Do not fold unrelated cleanup into this slice.

Before pushing:

```bash
git status
git diff
git log --oneline "origin/$BASE"..HEAD
```

Done when: all intended work is committed and the working tree holds no unexpected application-code changes.

## 8. Synchronize before the first push

Run the synchronization recipe's staleness check. If `git rev-list --count HEAD.."origin/$BASE"` is greater than zero, run the recipe.

Done when: the branch contains the current integration base and remains verified.

## 9. Push and create the PR

Push with `git push -u origin HEAD`.

Create exactly one PR for this slice. It must:

- target `$BASE`
- contain `Closes #<N>`
- identify the parent tracker where useful
- summarize delivered behavior
- record verification evidence and code-review status; the Greptile verdict line (score and clear-to-merge state) is added to the body once Greptile posts it — copied verbatim from the Greptile review comment, never invented — and becomes the canonical record of the review result
- record justified rejected/deferred findings
- note migration/preflight evidence for DB slices

A rebase rewrites pushed history — update the existing PR; never create a second one.

Done when: exactly one open PR represents this slice.

## 10. Babysit CI and the review verdict

Run CI and the review verdict as separate gates. Green CI is not the review verdict: a green Greptile check only means Greptile finished scanning.

```bash
gh pr checks <PR>
gh pr view <PR> --json body -q .body
```

**CI gate** — required checks are green.

**Review verdict gate** — the PR body is the canonical record of the Greptile review. Once Greptile posts its review, update the PR body to record the verdict it posted (its score and clear-to-merge statement), copied verbatim from the Greptile review comment — never written by you. Require the body to show the Greptile review is 5/5 and explicitly state it is clear to merge. Until the body carries that verdict, or the recorded score is below 5/5, the review is not done.

**Review threads gate** — every review comment thread is resolved: Greptile findings, `/code-review` findings, and human comments. Verify thread state via GraphQL (resolve OWNER/REPO from `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner`):

```bash
gh api graphql -F owner=OWNER -F name=REPO -F pr=<PR> -f query='
  query($owner:String!,$name:String!,$pr:Int!) {
    repository(owner:$owner,name:$name) {
      pullRequest(number:$pr) { reviewThreads(first: 50) { nodes { isResolved } } }
    }
  }'
```

A thread is resolved only when its `isResolved` is `true`. A comment is legit when its concern maps to real code or behavior in this slice — resolve it by fixing the concern or recording a justified rejection, never by ignoring it.

Pending checks are not completion, and green checks are not a resolved review.

After material fixes post-PR: rerun focused tests, `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, rerun `/code-review`, push, and wait for fresh CI/review state.

Done when: required CI is green, the PR body records a 5/5 Greptile review and states clear to merge, every review comment thread is resolved, and no known slice correctness issue remains.

## 11. Final synchronization gate

Green CI does not mean the branch is current. Run the synchronization recipe's readiness check (`git merge-base --is-ancestor "origin/$BASE" HEAD`).

- **Current** — proceed to finish.
- **Stale** — run the synchronization recipe, then re-run the readiness check.

Do not declare `MERGE_READY` while stale.

## 12. Finish

### Orchestrated mode

Do NOT merge. Verify the current PR head and the three merge gates — required CI green, PR body records a 5/5 Greptile review and states clear to merge, every review comment thread resolved — then report exactly:

```text
MERGE_READY: issue #<N>, PR #<P>, head <sha>
```

Then wait for the orchestrator, which owns the merge, worktree cleanup, child/parent closing, and any next slice.

If the orchestrator revokes readiness because `origin/$BASE` advanced, run the synchronization recipe and report a NEW:

```text
MERGE_READY: issue #<N>, PR #<P>, head <new-sha>
```

Old readiness is invalid once the base advances beyond it.

If this worker session is interrupted, leave Git and worktree state intact — the orchestrator owns recovery and may resume this same worktree.

Done when: `MERGE_READY` is reported with the current PR head, and the PR is intentionally unmerged.

### Standalone mode

Fetch `$BASE` once more and require `git merge-base --is-ancestor "origin/$BASE" HEAD`; if stale, run the synchronization recipe and re-check.

When current, required CI green, the PR body records a 5/5 Greptile review and states clear to merge, and every review comment thread is resolved, merge using the repository's established PR strategy. Confirm through GitHub that the PR is merged and issue #<N> is completed; leave the parent untouched.

Done when: the slice is merged into the integration branch.
